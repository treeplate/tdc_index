An index of all the pages on https://treeplate.damowmow.com/.
Written in pure HTML+CSS, with no external libraries.

Each card is a project, and you can press the Play button to use it.
Each card is actually an `<article>`, with an `<hgroup>` for the title+description, an `<h3>` for the title, and a `<p>` for the description. The button is really an `<a>` that's been styled to look like a button.
The first category of apps are written in Flutter, the second in just HTML/CSS/JS.
The way I do centering is stupid, it's just `padding-left: 35%;`.
